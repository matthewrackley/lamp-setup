# Changing the following options will not really affect the security of the
# server, but might make attacks slightly more difficult in some cases.

#
# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minimal | Minor | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#ServerTokens Minimal
ServerTokens Prod
#ServerTokens Full

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
#ServerSignature Off
ServerSignature EMail

#
# Allow TRACE method
#
# Set to "extended" to also reflect the request body (only for testing and
# diagnostic purposes).
#
# Set to one of:  On | Off | extended
TraceEnable Off
#TraceEnable On

#
# Forbid access to version control directories
#
# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
# probably deny access to their directories.
#
# Examples:
#
#RedirectMatch 404 /\.git
#RedirectMatch 404 /\.svn
